The working week should be shorter and workers should have a longer weekend. Do you agree or disagree?

There is a growing argument that the standard working week should be reduced, extending weekends for people to have more rest. While some argue this setting would enhance well-being and productivity, others fear economic drawbacks. I strongly agree that shorter work hours with longer weekends are beneficial for both workers and companies overall. This essay will explain why the advantages outweighs the potential concerns.

The most significant benefit of shorter workweeks is the improvement in workers's well-being and productivity. For example, as a software engineer, i often have to work late into the midnight, especially during the application updates when user is low. These long hours leave me extremely exhausted and reduce my motivation during the rest of the week. Additionally, A longer weekend would give people like me more time to rest, exercise, or spend time with family, helping us return to work with more energy and focus. In fact, many studies show that happier and healthier workers perform better and make fewer mistakes.

The another advantage of longer weekend is that it can boost the tourism industry. People with more time will spend more on travel, which can indirectly promote the social economy.

However, it is important to consider about the drawbacks of reducing the working days, especially in service industries. For instance, shorter week might make it hard to provide quick customer support, which would make users unhappy. While I believe these problem can be solved by arranging the work schedules more flexibly and using technology like AI to reduce the need during holidays.

In conclusion, although a shorter working week may cause some difficulties in certain fields, i believe that the positive effects on worker's well-being and productivity make it a worthwhile change.
