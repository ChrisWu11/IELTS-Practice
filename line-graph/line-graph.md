The line graph compares the <span style="color:red">amount of electricity produced</span> in France using four different <span style="color:red">sources of power</span> <span style="color:red">over a period of</span> 32 years.

It is clear that <span style="color:red">nuclear power</span> was <span style="color:red">by far the most important</span> <span style="color:red">means of electricity generation</span> <span style="color:red">over the period shown</span>. <span style="color:red">Renewables provided</span> the lowest <span style="color:red">amount of electricity</span> in each year.

In 1980, <span style="color:red">thermal power stations</span> were the main <span style="color:red">source of electricity</span> in France, <span style="color:red">generating</span> around 120 terawatt hours of power. <span style="color:red">Nuclear</span> and <span style="color:red">Hydroelectric power stations</span> produced just under 75 terawatt hours of electricity each. And <span style="color:red">Renewables provided a negligible amount</span>. Just one year later, <span style="color:red">Nuclear overtook Thermal power as the primary source of electricity</span>.

Between 1980 and 2005, electricity production from <span style="color:red">nuclear power</span> <span style="color:red">rose dramatically to a peak of</span> 430 terawatt hours. <span style="color:red">By contrast</span>, the <span style="color:red">Thermal power</span> fell to only 50 terawatt hours in 1985, and <span style="color:red">remained at this level</span> for the rest of the period. <span style="color:red">Hydroelectric power</span> generation <span style="color:red">remained relatively stable</span>, at between 50 and 80 terawatt hours, for the whole 32 year period. But <span style="color:red">Renewables</span> electricity production <span style="color:red">saw only a small rise</span> to approximately 25 terawatt hours in 2012.
