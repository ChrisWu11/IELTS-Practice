The <span style="color:red">bar chart compares</span> the number of mobile phones <span style="color:red">sold worldwide</span> by the five <span style="color:red">most popular manufacturers</span> in the years 2009, 2011 and 2013.

It is clear that Nokia <span style="color:red">sold the most</span> mobile phones between 2009 and 2011, but Samsung became the <span style="color:red">best selling brand</span> in 2013. Samsung and Apple <span style="color:red">saw the biggest rises</span> in <span style="color:red">sales</span> over the 5-year period.

In 2009, Nokia sold <span style="color:red">close to</span> 450 million mobile phones, which was <span style="color:red">almost double the number</span> of <span style="color:red">handsets</span> sold by the <span style="color:red">second most successful manufacturer</span>, Samsung. Over the following 4 years, however, Nokia's <span style="color:red">sales figures</span> fell by <span style="color:red">approximately</span> 200 million <span style="color:red">units</span>, whereas Samsung saw <span style="color:red">sales rise by a similar amount</span>. By 2013, Samsung had become the <span style="color:red">market leader</span> with <span style="color:red">sales</span> reaching 450 million <span style="color:red">units</span>.

The other three <span style="color:red">top selling</span> mobile phone <span style="color:red">brands</span> between 2009 and 2013 were LG, ZTE and Apple. In 2009, these <span style="color:red">companies</span> sold <span style="color:red">around</span> 125 million, 50 million and 25 million mobile <span style="color:red">handsets</span> <span style="color:red">respectively</span>, but Apple <span style="color:red">overtook the other two vendors</span> in 2011. In 2013, <span style="color:red">purchases</span> of Apple <span style="color:red">handsets</span> reached 150 million <span style="color:red">units</span>, while LG <span style="color:red">saw declining sales</span> and the figures for ZTE rose only slightly.
