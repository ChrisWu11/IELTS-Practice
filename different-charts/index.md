The bar chart compares the numbers of <span style="color:red">males and females</span> who <span style="color:red">took</span> four different evening classes in 2009, and the pie chart shows the age profile of these <span style="color:red">attendees</span>.

It is clear that <span style="color:red">significantly more</span> women than men <span style="color:red">attended</span> evening classes at the education centre. We can also see that evening courses were much more popular among older adults.

<span style="color:red">According to the bar chart</span>, drama, painting and language courses all <span style="color:red">attracted more women</span> than men to the education centre in 2009. Language classes <span style="color:red">had the highest number of participants</span> overall, with 40 female and 20 male <span style="color:red">students</span>, while painting was <span style="color:red">a popular choice among both genders</span>, attracting 30 female and 25 male attendees. The only course with a <span style="color:red">higher</span> number of males was sculpture, but this course <span style="color:red">was taken by a mere 15 people</span> in total.

<span style="color:red">Looking at the age profile pie chart</span>, we can see that <span style="color:red">the majority of people</span> attending evening lessons were over 40 years of age. <span style="color:red">To be precise</span>, 42% of them were aged 50 or more, and 26% were aged between 40 and 49. Younger adults <span style="color:red">were in the minority</span>, with only 11% of students aged 20 to 29, and only 5% aged under 20.
