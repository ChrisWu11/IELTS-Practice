# 饼状图

![饼状图](./pie-charts.png)

The pie charts compare five categories of household <span style="color:red">expenditure</span> in the UK and New Zealand in the years 1980 and 2008.

It is noticeable that the <span style="color:red">proportion of spending</span> on food and drink <span style="color:red">fell</span> in both countries <span style="color:red">over the 28-year period</span>, while <span style="color:red">spending</span> on utility bills <span style="color:red">rose</span>. Also, UK residents <span style="color:red">spent a significantly larger percentage</span> of their <span style="color:red">household budgets</span> on leisure <span style="color:red">than their New Zealand counterparts</span>.

In 1980, <span style="color:red">29% of an average New Zealand household budget went on</span> food and drink, while <span style="color:red">the equivalent figure for a UK home</span> was 23%. <span style="color:red">By 2008</span>, <span style="color:red">expenditure</span> on food and drink had <span style="color:red">fallen by 4%</span> in New Zealand, and by a full 10% in the UK. <span style="color:red">By contrast</span>, both countries <span style="color:red">saw an increase in</span> <span style="color:red">expenditure</span> on utility bills for the average home, from 27% to 31% in New Zealand and from 26% to 28% in the UK.

Leisure activities <span style="color:red">accounted for the highest proportion</span> of UK <span style="color:red">household spending</span> in both years, but only the third highest proportion in New Zealand. In fact, in 2008, New Zealanders <span style="color:red">spent only half as much in relative terms on</span> <span style="color:red">recreation</span> (17%) as UK residents (34%). In both countries, transport <span style="color:red">costs</span> and other <span style="color:red">costs</span> took roughly 15% and 10% of <span style="color:red">household budgets</span> <span style="color:red">respectively</span>.
