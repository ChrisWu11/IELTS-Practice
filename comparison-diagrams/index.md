## 范文

The two pictures compare the <span style="color:red">current layout</span> of the ground floor of a house with a <span style="color:red">plan to redesign</span> the same <span style="color:red">living space</span>.

<!-- 一个变化，一个没有变化 -->

We can see that the <span style="color:red">design proposal</span> involves making a number of changes to the ground floor of the house, mainly in the <span style="color:red">central hall area</span>. There are no plans to change external walls or entrances.

<!-- 选取一半作比较 -->

The most noticeable change from the <span style="color:red">existing</span> to the <span style="color:red">proposed</span> floor plan is that <span style="color:red">there will no longer be</span> a separate hall area <span style="color:red">when the building work has been done</span>. <span style="color:red">This will be achieved by removing</span> the internal wall and door between the hall and living room, along with the current <span style="color:red">staircase</span> and <span style="color:red">under-stair storage cupboard</span>. With no separate hall area, the proposed living room <span style="color:red">will also contain</span> the <span style="color:red">staircase</span> to the first floor.

To replace the current straight <span style="color:red">staircase</span>, <span style="color:red">a new set of winding stairs</span> <span style="color:red">will be installed</span> in the corner of the living room. The internal door between the hall and kitchen <span style="color:red">will also be replaced</span> with double doors connecting the kitchen with the new living room. Finally, the planned building work will also include<span style="color:red">the installation of some kitchen furniture</span>.
